# Dotfiles
A collection of my own personal dotfiles to sync configuration options and other customization across my linux computers

## Installation
Installation for now is really simple, just run this command to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/medijaster/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```
Then, once inside the folder, run:
```bash
./setup-scripts/setup-lns.sh
```

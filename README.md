# Dotfiles
A collection of my own personal dotfiles to sync configuration options and other customization across my linux computers

## Installation
Installation for now is really simple, just run:
`git clone https://github.com/MediJaster/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
to clone the repository, then run `setup-lns.sh` inside the setup-scripts folder
